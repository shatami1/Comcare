Absolutely — I can turn your notes into a clean, professional **system description** of your full web stack. Since you’re actively viewing your Netlify Domain Management tab, I’ll keep this tight and structured so you can drop it into documentation, onboarding, or technical support conversations without editing.

# **Comcare.store — System Architecture Overview**

## **1. Domain & DNS**
- **Registrar:** Squarespace  
- **DNS Management:** Squarespace DNS panel  
- **Current DNS Target:** Netlify (A‑records + CNAME configured)  
- **Live Domain:** `comcare.store` + `www.comcare.store`

---

## **2. Website Build** Visual Studio Code
- **Development:** Built with GitHub Copilot / AI-assisted workflow  
- **Codebase:** Static site (HTML/CSS/JS)  
- **Repository:** GitHub (private or local — not required for Netlify deploys)  
- **Framework:** No framework detected in the deployed output (pure static)

---

## **3. Hosting & Deployment**
- **Hosting Provider:** Netlify  
- **Project Dashboard:** `https://app.netlify.com`  
- **Deploy Method:** Manual deploys (drag‑and‑drop or direct upload)  
- **Primary Site:** `gleeful-vacherin-7b13d4.netlify.app`  
- **Connected Domain:** `comcare.store`  
- **SSL:** Auto‑provisioned by Netlify (Let’s Encrypt)

---

## **4. Forms & Email Handling**
- **Provider:** Formspree  
- **Active Endpoint:** `https://formspree.io/f/xykdkggg`  
- **Notes:**  
  - This is the correct endpoint; `/f/x` is not valid.  
  - Form submissions route to your configured email via Formspree’s backend.

---

## **5. Payments & Business Systems**
- **Payments:** Stripe Payment Links embedded in the site  
- **Accounting/ERP:**  
  - You mentioned Xero on your side  
  - **No Xero scripts, API calls, or embeds appear in the site code**  
  - This means Xero is used operationally, not integrated into the website

If you want, I can also produce:

- a **visual flowchart** (Mermaid, draw.io‑style, or ASCII)  
- a **technical architecture page** for your internal documentation  
- a **public-facing “How our system works”** page for your website  
- a **developer handoff document** for future contractors  

Just tell me the format you want and I’ll build it.
